\begin{abstract}
  This is a~brief overview of \amaya's submission to SMT-COMP 2024.
  \amaya is a standalone solver for quantified linear integer arithmetic (LIA) based on finite automata.
  It implements the standard automata-based decision procedure with several crucial optimizations that prune vast fractions of the underlying state space.
  Contrary to standard approaches, \amaya constructs a~compact representation of all models of the LIA formula.

\amaya is a~standalone solver for quantified \emph{linear integer arithmetic}
(LIA)\footnote{also sometimes referred to as \emph{Presburger arithmetic}}
based on finite automata (FAs).
The foundation of the decision procedure implemented in \amaya 
is the work of B\"{u}chi~\cite{Buchi60} (in the context of showing
automata-based decidability of the \emph{weak monadic second-order theory of
one successor}---WS1S---into which LIA can be encoded), which was later
tailored for LIA (including the linear congrurence operator) in the
works~\cite{BoudetC96,BoigelotJW05,Durand-GasselinH10}.
% and implemented in \lash~\cite{LASH}.
The basic procedure works by constructing an FA~$\autof \varphi$ for each atomic formula~$\varphi$, which
is of the form $a_1 x_1 + \ldots a_n x_n \sim c$ where ${\sim} \in \{{=},
{\leq}, {\equiv_m}\}$ for integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n, c$ and a natural
number~$m$.
The FA~$\autof \varphi$ represents all solutions of the formula~$\varphi$,
encoded as tuples of binary numbers in the two's complement encoding.

\amaya implements the procedure with several crucial optimizations described in~\cite{HabermehlHHHL24}.
